# H2M Profile Switcher

## Overview

**H2M Profile Switcher** is a program designed to help you manage and switch between different "user" folders in the game **H2M**. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you might want to have different profiles for different playstyles or for multiple users sharing the same computer.

For example, you might have one profile for grinding and another for casual play where everything is unlocked. The program makes it easy to swap between these profiles, ensuring that each user or playstyle has its own separate environment.

## How to Use

1. **Setting Up Profiles**:
   - Place the H2M Profile Switcher executable (`H2M Profile Switcher.exe`) in its own directory anywhere. Make sure no other folders are present with where the exe is stored.
   - Create a new profile by adding a folder in the same directory as the program executable. Each folder represents a different "user" profile.
   - Note: These user folders can be named anything as long as they have to proper files in them.

2. **Switching Profiles**:
   - Launch the `H2M Profile Switcher.exe`.
   - If you've added new profiles, either restart the program or click the "Refresh Profile List" button to see the new profiles.
   - Select the desired profile from the list and switch between them as needed.

3. **Important Considerations**:
   - The program modifies your game profiles, so it's recommended to make backups of your profiles before switching between them.
   - Make sure to set the path to the H2M directory where `h2m.exe` is located for the program to function correctly.

## Disclaimer

This program modifies game files, so please use it with caution. Always keep backups of your profiles to prevent any data loss.
