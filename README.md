# H2M Profile Switcher

## Overview

**H2M Profile Switcher** is a program designed to help you manage and switch between different "user" folders in the game **H2M**. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you might want to have different profiles for different playstyles or for multiple users sharing the same computer.

For example, you might have one profile for grinding and another for casual play where everything is unlocked. The program makes it easy to swap between these profiles, ensuring that each user or playstyle has its own separate environment.

## How to Use

1. **First Run**:
   - When you start the application for the first time, it will ask you to select a file.
   - You want to select your h2m exe. it doesnt matter what the name of your h2m is just select the exe.
   - Buttons:
      - "Set Profile": Takes the profile you selected in the program and replace your profile in H2M. MAKE BACKUPS!!!
      - "Set H2M Path": Allows you to re-set your H2M path if you moved your files or incorrectly chose the dir.
      - "Program Path": Opens file explorer to the root of this program. This makes it easy when you want to add new profiles or what not.
      - "H2M Path": Opens file explorer to the root of your H2M folder
      - "Refresh Profile List": Rescans the root of the program path to detect if new profiles have been added.
      - "Update Profile from H2M": Takes the current user folder from H2M and replaces the profile in the program. THIS REPLACES FILES SO IF YOUR NOT SURE MAKE BACKUPS!!
      - "New Profile": Allows you to make new profiles. Do not be alarmed if the new profile is empty. this is intended, when H2M detects an empty user folder it will populate it automatically.
      - "Delete Profile": Deletes the selected profile. THIS DELETES FILES SO BE CAREFUL!!
      - "Launch Game" Launches H2M directly from the app for easy use.

2. **Setting Up Profiles**:
   - Place the H2M Profile Switcher executable (`H2M Profile Switcher.exe`) anywhere. It does *NOT* have to be in the same folder as H2M
   - To add a already existing profile, copy the "user" from your H2M folder in the "H2M Profiles" folder.
   - Feel free to rename the copied folder to anything you like!
   - Each folder represents a different "user" profile.
   - Note: If you are unable to find the "H2M Profiles" folder, Create one. The program should have already created on first run.

3. **Switching Profiles**:
   - Launch the `H2M Profile Switcher.exe`.
   - If you've added new profiles, either restart the program or click the "Refresh Profile List" button to see the new profiles.
   - Select the desired profile from the list, then press "Set Profile" to replace the profile with the selected one. Switch between them as needed.

4. **Important Considerations**:
   - The program modifies your game profiles, so it's recommended to make backups of your profiles before switching between them.
   - Make sure to set the path to the H2M directory where `h2m.exe` is located for the program to function correctly.

## Disclaimer

This program modifies game files, so please use it with caution. Always keep backups of your profiles to prevent any data loss.
